# NRustLightning: C# lightning network daemon powered by [rust-lightning](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-lightning)

## Code organization

from low level to high level...

* `src/NRustLightning`
  * library to interoperate with rust-lightning through abi.
* `src/NRustLightning.Net`
  * library to connect above to the transport layer. primarily through TCP socket.
  * Probably this is the one you want to use if you are considering to build your own wallet.
* `src/NRustLightning.Infrastructure`
  * library which contains logic for both server and client.
* `src/NRustLightning.Server`
  * standalone LN daemon built with asp.net core server.
* `src/NRustLightning.Client`
  * C# client library for the server.
* `src/NRustLightning.CLI`
  * command-line application  to work with the server. Which wraps the client.
  * This is still pretty much WIP

## How to configure the server

`NRustLightning.Server` takes configuration options by either

* cli argument (e.g. `--https.port=443`)
* Environment variable  (e.g. `NRUSTLIGHTNING_HTTPS_PORT=443`)
* configuration ini file (WIP)

You can check all configuration options by running the following command.

```
git clone --recursive <this repository url>
dotnet run --project src/NRustLightning.Server -- --help 
```

You must make sure to connect to your [nbxplorer](https://github.com/dgarage/NBXplorer) instance by options which starts from `nbx`

If you don't have any, you can try with regtest in docker-compose. See below.

## Single file executable

`NRustLightning.CLI` and `NRustLightning.Server` supports single file executable.
Run

```
dotnet publish -c Release -r <your RID>
```

for which RID to use, see [microsoft official](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog)

For command line parsing, it uses [System.CommandLine](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api/).
If you think parsing is not working as expected, Directives in `System.CommandLine` might be useful. for ecample invoking with '[parse]' directive will be like...

```
cd src/NRustLightning.Server
dotnet run -- '[parse]' --regtest <whatever-options-you-want-to-pass>
```

## Test organization

From low level tests to high level tests...

* `NRustLightning.Tests.Common`
  * Common classes which used in more than two test packages.
* `NRustLightning.Tests`
  * basic tests for ABI.
* `NRustLightning.Net.Tests`
  * Tests which simulates P2P Network in memory. This cannot test the behavior with other lightning implementation.
* `NRustLightning.Server.Tests`
  * integration tests for the server and the client. See its own README.md for the detail.
  

## How to test the server

```
source tests/NRustLightning.Server.Tests/env.sh
docker-compose -f tests/NRustLightning.Server.Tests/docker-compose.yml up
./tests/NRustLightning.Server.Tests/docker-lnd-cli.sh
```

## API

We expose the swagger endpoint in debug build. If you want to check it out quickly, first run regtest server by

```
source tests/NRustLightning.Server.Tests/env.sh
docker-compose -f tests/NRustLightning.Server.Tests/docker-compose.yml up
```


and access to `http://localhost:10320/swagger/`
